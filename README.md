# Task Overview
This task inclued exploring and analyzing a car insurance dataset to understand the patterns, trends, and factors that influence insurance claim behavior. 
Through visualizations and feature-level analysis, the goal is to identify key indicators that contribute to the likelihood of a claim being made.

ðŸ“Š **Key Objectives**
1. Generate visual insights using matplotlib and seaborn
2. Understand feature relationships through correlation and pairplots
3. Identify anomalies, outliers, and class imbalance
4. Extract meaningful feature-level inferences to support future predictive modeling

ðŸ§  **Insights Gained**
* Drivers with a history of DUIs, low credit scores, or less driving experience are more likely to file a claim.
* Age and education level show trends in risk exposure.
* Several numeric features exhibit skewness or outliers which need preprocessing before modeling.
* The dataset shows class imbalance, suggesting the need for techniques like resampling or class weighting.
